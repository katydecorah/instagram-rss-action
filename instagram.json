      "content_html": "<p>@soulfirefarm</p><p>The Mohican Nation: \"People of the waters that are never still.\"\n\nSharing our stories, people to people, is such an important part of sovereignty work. Heather Bruegl from the Mohican nation presented to our team about the history and legacy of the Stockbridge Munsee Mohican people.\n\nAs people not indigenous to the land we inhabit, it has been integral that we explore the ways we can be accountable to the land’s original stewards. Part of our relationship building process has been establishing a cultural respect easement that gives Mohican citizens the legal right to use Soul Fire land for ceremony and wildcrafting whenever they please in perpetuity. As in years past, all proceeds of our seed sales are remitted to the Mohican nation for their cultural work.\n\nWe remain committed to ongoing solidarity with and accountability to the Mohican community. If you know anyone from the Mohican Nation, check out the flyer in the images - help them share their stories! Also pictured are beautiful ears of Mohican corn. \n\nThe corn was planted in the Stockbridge-Munsee Mohican style, as requested by Warren Mihtukwsun, \"The corn is planted in mounds. The mounds are about 32\" wide and 2 ft. tall. The Sturgeon and sucker run is always in the Spring. In the Spring we spear the suckers and put them in the mounds. This might be hard to replicate, but chicken bones, eggshells and/or compost could be put in the mounds if desired. Plant 12-13 corn seeds per mound, starting at the bottom of the mound and planting each seed \"from pinkie to thumb distance\" apart. If desired, plant beans \"around the outskirts of the mound\" at the same time as the corn. Some mounds could have sunflowers planted on them instead of corn.\" We are saving this seed and sharing with our Stockbridge Munsee Mohican friends in Wisconsin.</p><p><img src=\"https://scontent-atl3-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-15/e35/s1080x1080/156639945_930290294195813_1219547401368748653_n.jpg?tp=1&_nc_ht=scontent-atl3-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=105&_nc_ohc=CBVkAthKJQMAX-3Ek2T&ccb=7-4&oh=649e188f17f5d0ede1a7088d98195a22&oe=607EA014\" alt=\"\" /></p><p><img src=\"https://scontent-atl3-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-15/e35/s1080x1080/156514341_779065972734421_877853522006697457_n.jpg?tp=1&_nc_ht=scontent-atl3-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=101&_nc_ohc=wuzC10dQumUAX_147q6&ccb=7-4&oh=5af1eeeeca3548c335db1128e6c7383e&oe=607D7388\" alt=\"\" /></p><p><img src=\"https://scontent-atl3-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-15/e35/156484479_136301331720183_3035352374015746152_n.jpg?tp=1&_nc_ht=scontent-atl3-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=103&_nc_ohc=0CcfoiLUelUAX8myp13&ccb=7-4&oh=74ba1791f8a92919799a6c5d532bfc09&oe=607CC1B6\" alt=\"\" /></p><p><img src=\"https://scontent-atl3-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-15/e35/152429776_193128702584605_7250968947963371555_n.jpg?tp=1&_nc_ht=scontent-atl3-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=101&_nc_ohc=fzgMMAs-tfUAX_YQ0j7&ccb=7-4&oh=c45b6b0f5667ad69664ced479554e490&oe=60801FD9\" alt=\"\" /></p><p><img src=\"https://scontent-atl3-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-15/e35/156665227_138147918201300_7745863958992009391_n.jpg?tp=1&_nc_ht=scontent-atl3-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=100&_nc_ohc=h8fPJdEtlFwAX_TLSoW&ccb=7-4&oh=8efb28dad854c78f6a78157d248836ee&oe=607F9EFB\" alt=\"\" /></p>",

Virtual Bilingual Skill-share 3/11, 3-4:30 pm ET. \n\nIf you haven’t registered yet for our first 3D of 2021, you still have time! Head to the link in our bio to register by noon on 3/10!\n\nWe are kicking off this year’s 3D Virtual Skill-share series with a visionary workshop guided by SFF Co-Director Larisa Jacobson and Rock Steady Farmer (@rocksteadyfarm ) Amara Ullari (@mishi_amara) \n\nWe are invoking the quiet and stillness that the winter offers to guide us in reflection, dreaming, and planning for how our upcoming growing season will flourish. This visionary practice is what we call crop planning, a process that paints a big picture idea of what we will be growing over the season and then breaks it down to the details of how we will achieve our goals to ensure an abundant season. \n\nThis interactive virtual skill share is designed for BIPOC and features Spanish interpretation. Amara (@mishi_amara) also shares their Crop Planning brilliance in our forthcoming Liberation on Land Video coming soon!

And we see the light at the end of the tunnel!\n With the final coats of plasters near completion, we are installing interior and exterior doors, as well as finishing the ventilation system. \n\nThis was designed in the early stages of covid to adapt to the needs of being healthy indoors together. We now see that this decision was a good one that will help us keep people as safe as possible. We also have been installing lighting fixtures (which we think look FIRE!), and are preparing to install local hardwood floors. \n\nThe construction team is also enduring late winter storms and harsh temperatures to install the exterior siding. What lies underneath is a thoughtful design that creates a robust durable finish, keeping the building dry and ventilated for decades to come. \n\nWe think of every building project as a metaphor for our relationships: there is so much we cannot see below the surface.

      "content_html": "<p>@soulfirefarm</p><p>The sap rises in the maple trees and the streams start to flow under the snow pack. For the farmers, this is greenhouse seeding time. We tuck dormant packets of genetic possibility into moist potting soil and wait for onions, cilantro, parsley, lettuce and other “cold crops” to germinate. \n\nWe pay homage to our ancestors for their innovation in these greenhouse technologies. We give thanks to the 1000+ enslaved African people on the Wye Plantation, including Frederick Douglass, who built, engineered, and operated an impressive greenhouse in 1775 that still stands. \n\nThey buried their protective amulets at the entrance, hid their sacred thunderstones in the roof, cultivated hundreds of culinary and medicinal plants, and held celebrations with song and dance in the space.

      "content_html": "<p>@soulfirefarm</p><p>The abundance of food and medicine either grown by your own hand or those that are birthed effortlessly by the land extends far beyond the growing season. Leah was able to restock our shop with soothing, luxurious salves! Salves are simple to make, completely plant-based, and nourishing. Homemade medicines are infused not only with the magic of the Earth, but also with love and the intention of healing and relief. \n\nOur shop is stocked with two different salves that promote different types of healing. We have our Soothing Salve that is a healing body butter containing olive oil, Soul Fire beeswax, calendula, comfrey, and peppermint. This salve helps relieve insect bites, diaper rash, dryness, scrapes, and minor irritation. It’s the perfect salve for summertime when the mosquitos come out. \n\nWe also have a White Pine Salve that contains olive oil, Soul Fire beeswax, and wildcrafted white pine needles and resin from the sacred land that Soul Fire Farm sits on. This salve has antiseptic, antifungal, and antibacterial properties making it highly effective in treating eczema, psoriasis, rashes and other skin irritations.\n\nHead to the link in our bio to purchase and take a look at the other items in our shop.</p><p><img src=\"https://scontent-atl3-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-15/e35/158366599_1109452619480340_9022426546862629924_n.jpg?tp=1&_nc_ht=scontent-atl3-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=100&_nc_ohc=Fx-Rw5waZngAX-MtixP&ccb=7-4&oh=c21bd5b01de21a92a2f92214f7f4c0b7&oe=607DAC07\" alt=\"\" /></p>",

I represented the black-eyed pea because it is a sacred food indigenous to Africa that is staple throughout the diaspora and shows up in so many beloved dishes (akra pwa, acaraje, hoppin' john...) and is a symbol of prosperity, blessings, and fertility. Also black-eyed peas are legumes that build soil health, like alchemists taking nitrogen from the air and giving it back to the earth, a method popularized by George Washington Carver, who was born into slavery and overcame unthinkable obstacles to become a pioneering agricultural scientist.” ~ Naima Penniman @naimainfinity\n\nWhat are the barriers in your life that feel impossible to push past?\n\nWhat are the oppressions that seem so entrenched in the fabric of our society?\n\nWhat are the seeds we can smuggle in the face of that, that might find a future on fertile ground?\n\nYou can purchase a 11\"x17\" print of Naima’s dedication painting for \"Farming While Black\" by Leah Penniman. Available on our online store for $15.
